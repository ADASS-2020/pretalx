    <h1>Welcome to pretalx's documentation</h1>
    <p>

        <p>pretalx is an open source conference management tool – it allows you
        to create Calls for Participation, customise them, read and review
        submissions, choose your conference's talks, schedule them (on as many
        days and in as many rooms you need), and release versioned schedules.
        And it can do even more – check the <a href="/en/latest/features">
        features</a> page for details.</p>

        <p>We work a lot to make our documentation as up to date, usable and
        complete as possible. We want you to be able understand, use, run, and
        improve pretalx, but of course, this website will never be perfect, or
        even comprete.  If there is anything unclear or specifically missing,
        we'd be happy if you'd
