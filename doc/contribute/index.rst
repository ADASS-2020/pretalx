I want to contribute!
=====================

That's great, we love contributions! Being an open source project, pretalx can only survive if it receives
regular contributions from the community. Everyone is able to contribute, because contributions can be
basically anything: Code, Documentation, Translations, Graphics, Feedback etc. and all of them are
highly appreciated.

This part of the documentation tries to give you some information that you might need on the way. But don't
worry, if you still get stuck: It's not you, it's us! This documentation is in a very early stage and might
be incomplete. So do not hesitate do send us questions -- and afterwards, contribute to the documentation to
help the next one who is running into the same problem ;)
