`pretalx` provides a conference planning tool, featuring

- CfP and talk submission support with a clean interface
- Accepting/rejecting proposals
- Communicating with speakers (availability times, further questions)
- Tools for building and publishing a schedule
- Interfaces and APIs for related tools
- Easy-to-use orga interface
- Different, pluggable review processes

Project status
--------------

`pretalx` is currently unfinished. It supports everything required for talk submission, but has still
limited support for review and schedule planning. You can monitor the current status in the issues_
of this repository. Milestones show the current progress towards both of these goals.

Alternatives
------------

`pretalx` tries to do the same things `frab`_ does, and hence owes a lot to both frab and `pentabarf`_.
