`pretalx` provides a conference planning tool â€“ read our extensive `feature list`_ in our docs!

Project status
--------------

`pretalx` is currently unfinished. It supports everything required for talk submission, but has still
limited support for review and schedule planning. You can monitor the current status in the issues_
of this repository. Milestones show the current progress towards both of these goals.

Alternatives
------------

`pretalx` tries to do the same things `frab`_ does, and hence owes a lot to both frab and `pentabarf`_.

Contributing
------------
If you want to contribute to pretalx, please choose an issue and comment on it if anything is unclear. If
you find bugs you want to fix yourself, please also open an issue, just for documentation purposes.
Check our `developer documentation`_ on how to set up pretalx.
